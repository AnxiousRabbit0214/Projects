By running mcts.c++, you can play against the connect 4 game AI that never fails (unless you cheat!!!)

The game AI is implemented using traditional monte-carlo tree search with the help of UCB1 formula in order to maximize the exploitation/exploration factor. 200000 simulations will be performed and with a game tree been constructed/destroyed in every step. 


g.c++

Alglrithms contains a c++ file and a example input file. The c++ program has the implementation of two algorithms which will take an undirect graph (input file) and output a file that contains the shortest path from the first node to every other nodes.
