By running mcts.c++, you can play against the connect 4 game AI that never fails (unless you cheat!!!)

The game AI is implemented using traditional monte-carlo tree search with the help of UCB1 formula in order to maximize the exploitation/exploration factor. 200000 simulations will be performed and with a game tree been constructed/destroyed in every step. 



bj.c++ is a simple program I wrote when suffering from the lack of internet/wifi for TWO DAYS during the break.
By running bj.c++, you can play BlackJack with the computer. I win about 50% of the time playing against it. 



Alglrithms contains a c++ file and a example input file. The c++ program has the implementation of two algorithms which will take an undirect graph (input file) and output a file that contains the shortest path from the first node to every other nodes.
